Hackathon Prototype Build

Started with a bootstrap template, created a small database using data given to us. Input links to page with list of mental health providers from the database and another link to a page which was meant to find nearest mental health provider however it currently only takes in two addresses and finds the distance between them. This uses the google maps API. The goal for that web page was to compare a subset of our database with an input address and return the closest addresses.
